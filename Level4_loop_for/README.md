# Level4_loop_for
## What is a loop?

Normally, if you want to display out a lot of output. You will write something like this :

```php
<?php
 echo 2004;
 echo 2008;
 echo 2012;
 // And so on
?>
```

### 1. For Loop
But, by using `loop`, you can save your time and shorten your length of your code, which will look something like this : 

```php
<?php
  for ($leap = 2004; $leap < 2050; $leap = $leap + 4) {
        echo "<p>$leap</p>";
      }
?>
```

### 2. ForEach = Loops + Arrays 

The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over each element of an objectâ€”which makes it perfect for use with arrays!

You can think of `foreach` as jumping from element to element in the array and running the code between `{}`s for each of those elements.

E.G: 

```php
<?php
 $langs = array("JavaScript",
          "HTML/CSS", "PHP",
          "Python", "Ruby");
        
          foreach ($langs as $lang) {
              echo "<li>$lang</li>";
          }
        
          unset($lang);
?>
```
**Output**
```php
1. JavaScript 
2. HTML/CSS
3. PHP 
4. Python 
5. Ruby 
```

### 3. While Loop
In a stituation where you have no idea how many times the loop should repeat. Then use `while` loop.

A `while` loop will execute as long as a certain condition is `true`. For example, the loop in the editor will simulate coin flips as long as the number of consecutive heads is less than 3.

```php
<?php
 $headCount = 0;
	$flipCount = 0;
	while ($headCount < 3) {
		$flip = rand(0,1);
		$flipCount ++;
		if ($flip){
			$headCount ++;
			echo "<div class=\"coin\">H</div>";
		}
		else {
			$headCount = 0;
			echo "<div class=\"coin\">T</div>";
		}
	}
	echo "<p>It took {$flipCount} flips!</p>";
?>
```
