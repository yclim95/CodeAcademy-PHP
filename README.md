## What is PHP for ?
PHP is a programming language that can do all sorts of things: evaluate form data sent from a browser, build custom web content to serve the browser, talk to a database, and even send and receive cookies (little packets of data that your browser uses to remember things, like if you're logged in to Codecademy).

## Why learn PHP ? 

### 1. JavaScript
Generally runs in the browser, or **client**. This means it only really knows what's going on in your browser, plus whatever information it gets from the website(s) you're connecting to.

### 2. PHP
Runs on the same computer as the website you're visiting, which is known as the **server**. This means that it has access to all the information and files on that machine, which allows it to construct custom HTML pages to send to your browser, handle cookies, and run tasks or perform calculations with data from that website.
